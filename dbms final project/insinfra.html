            <p>Control Systems Lab:

                This lab is dedicated to the study of control systems and the design of controllers.
                Students work with different types of control systems, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, and study their behavior in real-time.
                Experiments may involve the control of temperature, pressure, and level using feedback control systems.</p>

            <p> Process Control Lab:

                This lab is dedicated to studying advanced control systems used in industrial processes.
                Students work with pilot-scale process plants and implement control strategies for processes like temperature control, flow control, and pressure control.</p>
